        Timestamp Microservice
 <ul>
<li>Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.</li>

<li>Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.</li>

<li>Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:</li>

<li>User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).</li>

<li>User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.</li>

<li>User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.</li>

<li>Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Glitch.</li>

<li>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.</li>
   </ul>
